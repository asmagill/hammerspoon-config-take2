Personal Configuration for Hammerspoon, Take 2
==============================================

I have recently moved to a new laptop and it seemed a convenient time to pair down my configuration and see what I was really using and clean out some of the cruft, tweak and clean up some files, etc.

You can find the previous repository for my configuration files at https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon-config. It is likely that over time this one will get as full and as messy, but at least for a few precious moments in time...

Mostly random junk I find useful, a few tips and tricks that might be interesting, and a playground for the hamster running on the squeaky wheel of my brain.

Modules which aren't currently in the Hammerspoon core, and are also not in one of the sub-directories here, can most likely be found in one of the following places:

1. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm
2. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm.undocumented
